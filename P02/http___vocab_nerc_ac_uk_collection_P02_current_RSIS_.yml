  original: Parameters quantifying the electrical properties of geological units in
    the field. Includes parameters used to determine resistivity structure for shallow
    sediment properties, porosities and presence of hydrocarbon (CSEM), deeper crust
    and mantle studies (Magnetotellurics) and ore body location (polarisation).
