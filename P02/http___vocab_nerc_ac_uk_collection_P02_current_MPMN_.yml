  original: Parameters expressing depth (possibly as pressure) of an instrument on
    a suspended underwater mooring.  These are primarily collected to monitor mooring
    performance by quantifying knock-down and should not be regarded as instrument
    z co-ordinates (accurate calibration is rare) or as sea level measurements.
