  original: Concentration parameters for trace metalloid elements and inorganic selenium
    species in the particulate phase of any body of fresh or salt water collected
    by fitration, centrifugation or sediment trapping. Trace metalloids are considered
    as B, Ge, As, Sb, Te and Po (but not Si which is classed separately because of
    its major role in environmental chemistry).
