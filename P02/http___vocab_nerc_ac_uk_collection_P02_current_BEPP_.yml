  original: Parameters associated with the quantification of primary production by
    plants living on (e.g. corals, seaweed and seagrass) or in (e.g. benthic diatoms)
    the seabed.  Primary production is defined as the fixation of carbon dioxide into
    either organic or inorganic carbon by living entities and so includes photosynthesis
    and calcification.
