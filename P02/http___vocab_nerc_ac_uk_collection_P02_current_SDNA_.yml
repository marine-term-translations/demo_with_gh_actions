  original: Parameters quantifying the amount of naturally-produced organic (molecules
    containing carbon) compounds that are built from multiple instances of structural
    units (monomers) that are covalently-bonded to produce larger structures in any
    sediment (material collected by a corer including fluff). Includes polynucleotides
    (RNA and DNA), polypeptides and polysaccharides (e.g. cellulose).
